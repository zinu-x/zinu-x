             I am currently studying ITMD541, a course on the knowledge system of web programming.
            <br>
            <br>
            Learning HTML and CSS has been a very interesting and enriching experience for me.
            This is because I have always been involved in backend programming and this is my first
            systematic exposure to frontend technology.
            I found that the learning process for HTML and CSS requires a lot of practice.
            I need to write code and create web pages myself to truly understand and master these skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, learning HTML and CSS has given me a deep understanding of web design and provided me
            with the opportunity to practice and create my own web pages.
            Although I sometimes encounter difficulties and frustrations,
            I feel very satisfied and proud when I see the web pages I have created successfully running in the browser.
